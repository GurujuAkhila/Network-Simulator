# Network-Simulator
### Implemented Physical layer functionalities
1. Creating end devices, hubs
2. Creating connections between them to form a topology
3. Sending and receiving data
4. Created two end devices with a dedicated connection and enable data transmission between them. Note that this is only a simulation as no real data can be shared.
5. Created a star topology with five end devices connected to a hub
and enable communication within end devices. This followed the exact working principles of hub.

### Implement Data Link layer functionalities
1. Created a layer 2 device: switch
2. Performed address learning in case of switch
3. Implemented two flow control protocols: Stop and Wait ARQ and Selective Repeat
4. Created a switch with five end devices connected to it and enable data transmission between them. Performed each of the flow control protocols.
5. Create two star topologies with five end devices connected to a hub in each case and then connect two hubs using a switch. Enabled communication between all 10 end devices and updated the MAC table

### Implemented Network layer and Trasport layer functionalities.
1. Created a router
2. Assigning port no.’s to various processes, both well known and ephemeral port no.’s and enable process-process communication
3. Implemented Transport layer protocols- UDP and TCP

### Implemented Application layer functionalities
1. Implemented HTTP.
